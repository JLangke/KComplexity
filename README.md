KComplexity
===========

A study of the Kolmogorov complexity of small works of art. We generate all small works of art (keeping track of the Kolmogorov complexity of each), and then we ask people to rate each artwork's visual complexity.

Our work was done using Racket and MiniKanren.  We have included a presentation of our initial results, and are working on a paper.

By Tuesday: Peter will have implemented an intial version of the visual complexity survey

By Tuesday: Jonathan will have pushed to github from his own computer, and have added a discussion of the 2x2 art to the article.
