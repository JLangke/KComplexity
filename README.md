KComplexity
===========

A study of the Kolmogorov complexity of small works of art. We generate all small works of art (keeping track of the Kolmogorov complexity of each), and then we ask people to rate each artwork's visual complexity.

Our work was done using Racket and MiniKanren.  We have included a presentation of our initial results, and are working on a paper.
