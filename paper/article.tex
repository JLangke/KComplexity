\begin{abstract}
We define formula complexity based on a restriction of formula complexity,
and measure the formula complexity of all possible \twoxtwo\ and \threexthree\
artworks.  We have also conducted a survey of the relative perceived visual
complexity of these artworks, and we report that survey's results.  We end by
discussing the links between these two notions, and find that formula
complexity does seem to be related to visual complexity.

\section{Introduction}

We explore the complexity of simple digital artworks, both from a formal
mathematical standpoint and from a human experience standpoint.  Art has many
definitions, but the one we will use is that a piece of black and white digital
art is a matrix where every entry is either true or false.  This can be thought
of as a matrix of boolean values, where true corresponds to black and false
corresponds to white, or it can be thought of as the output of a formula.  An
artwork can be generated from a mathematical formula that evaluates to a
boolean and involves integers $x$ and $y$.  For our initial study, we consider
only \twoxtwo\ matrices, because there are only $2^{2\cdot2} = 16$ of them,
which allows for careful study of each step in our analysis pipeline.  Once we
see the properties of \twoxtwo\ artworks, we extend our work to \threexthree\
artworks.

The formula complexity or program-size complexity of a particular object is
the size of the smallest program which outputs that object.  This allows us to
talk about the complexity (and randomness) of individual items. Formula
complexity is, unfortunately, uncomputable.  It is, however, recursively
enumerable (RE).  Therefore, we can enumerate all well-typed expressions and
evaluate them on multiple inputs.  The size of the smallest expression which
outputs that object is then its formula complexity!

Our algorithm to generate all the art, and keep track of its formula
complexity is as follows: Enumerate all well-typed formulae of size 1.  For
each enumerated formula, generate its corresponding artwork.  If this artwork
has not been previously generated, then it has Kolmogorov complexity 1.  Next,
we repeat for size 2, 3, 4, etc., until we have managed to generate all
possible \twoxtwo\ artworks.  To do this, however, we must first define what we
mean by a ``well-typed formula''.

A formula is well-typed if the inputs types of all functions\footnote{So as not
to get distracted by issues of operator precedence, formulae will often be
presented fully parenthesized in prefix notation.} match the type of those
function's arguments.  An example of an ill-typed formula is {\tt (+ false 3)},
whereas a well-typed formula is {\tt (+ 3 x)}.  We further require that the
overall type of our formula be {\tt bool}.  An example of such an expression is
{\tt (< x y)}, which is an expression involving integers with two inputs that
evaluates to either true or false.

Further, we also need to define our programming language with which to express
our formulae.  Our language is constructed out of the atoms {\tt < + * x y 1 0
and or not true false}.  As a side note, every formula in our language is also
a valid Racket program\cite{LittleSchemer}, which greatly aided us in
evaluation.

\section{Combined Results}

\label{fig:scatter}
\end{figure}

Once we have a measured formula complexity (Section~\ref{sec:formula}) and a
measured visual complexity (Section~\ref{sec:visual}), we plot them together.
The resulting plot may be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:scatter}.  Also included in
that plot is a line of best fit.  Visually examining the plot, we see that
there might be correlation.  Actually computing the Pearson correlation
coefficient results in a correlation coefficient of \input{3x3correlation.tex}
and an extremely low p-value ($4\cdot10^{-39}$).  All of which implies that the
two measurements are strongly correlated and it is very unlikely that this
result is due to chance.  Therefore, formula complexity is correlated with visual complexity! 

\section{Summary and Future Work}

We defined a notion of formula complexity, which served as a ``low power''
version of Kolmogorov complexity.  We enumerated all well-typed formulae to
discover the formula complexity of a large set of very small artworks.  We then
asked a self-selected set of people to assess the visual complexity of the
artworks.  We found a nice relationship between perceived visual complexity and
formula complexity, although our results may suffer from the strong law of
small numbers\cite{smallnumbers}.  A relationship between visual complexity and
formula complexity suggests that how our brains decide whether something is
``complex'' may have a lot to with whether that item is computationally
complex!  We found this to be quite an exciting result, as it draws a direct
connection between the notion of complexity in two separate domains: brains and
computational machines.

Anybody interested in reproducing or extending our results is encouraged to
fork our repository on
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JLangke/KComplexity}} and use the code
however you see fit.  Our data and analysis pipeline are all in the repository
as well.  Extending our results to larger artworks would, in particular, be
quite interesting.  Discovering what languages have formula complexity that
best matches the perceived visual complexity would also be quite interesting,
as it would help explicate this deep link between complexity of perception and
complexity of computation.
