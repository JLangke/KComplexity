\begin{abstract}
We have measured (using Racket and MiniKanren) the Kolmogorov Complexity of all
possible 2x2 and 3x2 artworks.  We have also conducted a survey of the relative
perceived visual complexity of these artworks.  In this paper, we discuss both
our generation strategy as well as the results of our online survey.
