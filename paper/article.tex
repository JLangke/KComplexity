\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We define formula complexity based on a restriction of formula complexity,
and measure the formula complexity of all possible \twoxtwo\ and \threexthree\
artworks.  We have also conducted a survey of the relative perceived visual
complexity of these artworks, and we report that survey's results.  We end by
discussing the links between these two notions, and find that formula
complexity does seem to be related to visual complexity.

\section{Introduction}

Art has many definitions, but the one we will use here is that a piece of black
and white digital art is a matrix where every entry is either true or false.
An artwork can be generated from a mathematical formula that evaluates to a
boolean and involves integers $x$ and $y$.  For our initial study, we
considered only \twoxtwo\ matrices, because there are only $2^{2\cdot2} = 16$
of them, and they could therefore be exhaustively generated.

The formula complexity or program-size complexity of a particular object is
the size of the smallest program which outputs that object.  This allows us to
talk about the complexity (and randomness) of individual items. Formula
complexity is, unfortunately, uncomputable.  It is, however, recursively
enumerable (RE).  Therefore, we can enumerate all well-typed expressions and
evaluate them on multiple inputs.  The size of the smallest expression which
outputs that object is then its formula complexity!

Our algorithm to generate all the art, and keep track of its formula
complexity is as follows: Enumerate all well-typed programs of size 1.  For
each enumerated formula, generate its corresponding artwork.  If this artwork
has not been previously generated, then it has Kolmogorov complexity 1.  Next,
we repeat for size 2, 3, 4, etc., until we have managed to generate all
possible \twoxtwo\ artworks.  To do this, however, we must first define what we
mean by a ``well-typed program''.

A program is well-typed if the inputs types of the functions match the type of
those function's arguments.  An example of an ill-typed program is {\tt (+
false 3)}, whereas a well-typed program is {\tt (+ 3 x)}.  We further require
that the overall type of our program be {\tt (int, int) -> bool}.  An example
of such an expression is {\tt ($\lambda$ (x y) (< x y))}, which is an
expression with two inputs, which evaluates to either true or false.

Further, we also need to define our programming language.  Our language is
constructed out of the atoms {\tt < + * x y 1 0 and or not true false}.  As a
side note, every formula in our language is also a valid Racket
program\cite{LittleSchemer}, which greatly aided us in evaluation.

\section{Combined Results}

\label{fig:scatter}
\end{figure}

Once we have a measured formula complexity (Section~\ref{sec:formula}) and a
measured visual complexity (Section~\ref{sec:visual}), we plot them together.
The resulting plot may be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:scatter}.  Also included in
that plot is a line of best fit.  Visually examining the plot, we see that
there might be correlation.  Actually computing the Pearson correlation
coefficient results in a correlation coefficient of \input{3x3correlation.tex}
and an extremely low p-value ($4\cdot10^{-39}$).  All of which implies that the
two measurements are strongly correlated and it is very unlikely that this
result is due to chance.

\section{Summary and Future Work}

We defined a notion of formula complexity, which served as a ``low power''
version of Kolmogorov complexity.  We enumerated all well-typed formulae to
discover the formula complexity of a large set of very small artworks.  We then
asked a self-selected set of people to assess the visual complexity of the
artworks.  We found a nice relationship between perceived visual complexity and
formula complexity, although our results may suffer from the strong law of small
numbers\cite{smallnumbers}.

Anybody interested in reproducing or extending our results is encouraged to
fork our repository on
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JLangke/KComplexity}} and use the code
however you see fit.  Extending our results to larger artworks would, in
particular, be quite interesting.  Discovering what languages have formula
complexity that best matches the perceived visual complexity would also be
quite interesting, as it would suggest (and perhaps help explicate) a deep link
between complexity of perception and complexity of computation.
