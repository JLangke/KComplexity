\begin{abstract}
We have measured (using Racket and MiniKanren) the Kolmogorov Complexity of all
possible 2x2 and 3x2 artworks.  We have also conducted a survey of the relative
perceived visual complexity of these artworks.  In this paper, we discuss both
our generation strategy as well as the results of our online survey.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Art has many definitions, but the one we will use here is that a piece of black
and white digital art is a matrix where every entry is either true or false.
An artwork can be generated from a mathematical formula that evalutes to a
boolean and involves integers $x$ and $y$.  For our initial study, we
considered only 2x2 matrices, because there are only $2^{2\cdot2} = 16$ of
them, and they could therefore be exhaustively generated.

The Kolmogorov Complexity or program-size complexity of a particular object is
the size of the smallest program which outputs that object.  This allows us to
talk about the complexity (and randomness) of individual items.  Kolmogorov
complexity is, unfortunately, uncomputable.  It is, however, recursively
enumerable (RE).  Therefore, we can enumerate all well-typed expressions and
evaluate them on multiple inputs.  The size of the smallest expression which
outputs that object is then its Kolmogorov complexity!

Our algorithm to generate all the art, and keep track of its Kolmogorov
Complexity is as follows: Enumerate all well-typed programs of size 1.  For
each enumerated formula, generate its corresponding artwork.  If this artwork
has not been previously generated, then it has Kolmogorov complexity 1.  Next,
we repeat for size 2, 3, 4, etc., until we have managed to generate all
possible 2x2 artworks.  To do this, however, we must first define what we mean
by a ``well-typed program''.

A program is well-typed if the inputs types of the functions match the type of those function's arguments.  An example of an ill-typed program is {\tt (+ false 3)}, whereas a well-typed program is {\tt (+ 3 x)}.  We further require that the overall type of our program be {\tt (int, int) -> bool}.  An example of such an expression is {\tt ($\lambda$ (x y) (< x y))}, which is an expression with two inputs, which evalutes to either true or false.

Further, we also need to define our programming language.  Our language is constructed out of the atoms {\tt < + * x y 1 0 and or not true false}.  With this description, we use MiniKanren, a logic programming system for Racket, to generate a list of all well-typed programs in order of size.

\subsection{Racket/MiniKanren}

To fully understand the power of Racket and MiniKanren one needs to understand 
how it is that Logic Languages operate. MiniKanren (like any logic language) is
used to satisfy relationships specified by the user. In our application this was used
to generate all formulae up to a particular size(in symbols) and then produce the
corresponding pictorial output (depicted below).

\section{Generating The Art}{

After generating all the formulae to a particular size the next step in our Algorithm is
to generate all the art corresponding to each formulae as depicted in the example seen
previously. When we where able to produce all the 2x2 art we where able to garner alot of
insight into the interrelatedness of the different artwork.

The associations seen in levels 3-5 and comparing the one seen in level 7 and 8 allowed us
insight and we began to think about Visual Complexity and it's relation to KC.

\subsection{Beginning to Associate Percieved Visual and Kolmogorov Complexity}

At this point we began to wonder if visual and Kolmogorov complexity
was in any way correlated. We thought about different strategies in order to collect 
unbiased data and decided to implement the data collection in the following way:
