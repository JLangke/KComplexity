\section{Assessing Visual Complexity}

\label{sec:visual}

There is an intuitive notion of ``visual complexity'', but it is unclear
whether any two people would agree on whether a particular artwork is visually
complex. It is also not known whether visual complexity is related to
computational complexity.  In an effort to discover whether visual complexity
is something that people agree upon, and to discover whether formula complexity
is related to perceived visual complexity, we conducted a survey via a website.

We constructed two websites that asked visitors to choose which of two images
they found to be of greater visual complexity.  One website asked about all the
\twoxtwo\ art, and the other asked about all of the \threexthree\ art.  Both
such sizes are small enough to completely enumerate (there are 16 and 512
artworks in each respective category) as well as small enough to calculate the
formula complexity of each artwork.

We then asked users on Twitter as well as local campus students to repeatedly
assess which of two images they found more visually complex.  We treated each
assessment as if it were a competition between two players (artwork one vs
artwork two), and when the user decided upon a winner, we used the
TrueSkill\texttrademark\cite{trueskill}\ algorithm to update each artwork's relative visual
complexity based on each match's results.
