\section{Assessing Visual Complexity}

We constructed two websites that asked visitors to choose which of two images
they found to be of greater visual complexity.  One website asked about all the
2x2 art, and the other asked about all of the 3x3 art.  Both such sizes are
small enough to completely enumerate (there are 16 and 512 artworks in each
respective category) as well as small enough to calculate the Kolmogorov
complexity of each artwork.

We then asked users on Twitter as well as local campus students to repeatedly
assess which of two images they found more visually complex.  We treated each
assessment as if it were a competition between two players (artwork one vs
artwork two), and when the user decided upon a winner, we used the TrueSkill
algorithm to update each artwork's relative complexity based on each match's
results.
